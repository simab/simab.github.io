            <p> GOVERNMENT 20: FOUNDATIONS OF COMPARATIVE POLITICS
 (Fall 2024) 

Professor Steven Levitsky
Email: levitsky@gov.harvard.edu
Office: CGIS-South, Room S-204
Zoom Office: https://harvard.zoom.us/j/9655095666

Head TF:  Julia Coyoli (Julia_coyoli@g.harvard.edu)

This course introduces students to major theories and concepts in comparative politics, as well as the basic tools of comparative analysis.  It explores competing theoretical approaches (Modernization, Marxist, cultural, institutionalist, and leadership-centered) to four major phenomena in world politics: (1) economic development; (2) democratization; (3) social revolution; and (4) ethnic conflict.  It also explores debates about the role of political institutions (e.g., presidential/parliamentary systems, political parties, electoral systems), states and state-building, and civil society in shaping political outcomes.   These theoretical debates are examined through an analysis of cases from across the globe, including Africa (Congo, Liberia, Rwanda, South Africa), the Americas (Chile, United States), Asia (China, India, South Korea, Taiwan), Western Europe (Italy, Germany, Great Britain), Eastern Europe (Russia, Yugoslavia), and the Middle East (Egypt, Iran, Lebanon).  The final week examines the United States in comparative perspective.

Course Format

Lectures: Lectures will be held every Tuesday and Thursday (10:30-11:45)

Discussion Sections: All students must attend a weekly hour-long discussion section, run by a Government 20 Teaching Fellow. Students will be assigned to a section during the first week of the semester. All sections will be held on Thursday and Friday. Section attendance is mandatory.  

Office Hours: Tuesday 1:30-3:00 and Thursday 4-5pm.   Come to office hours!  Office hours fill up, so please write to Leslie Kress (kress@fas.harvard.edu) to reserve a slot.

Course Requirements

1) Section participation (15 percent of grade).   

2) Two short papers (6-8 pages), based on course materials, on topics to be handed out in class.  Due October 8 (10 percent of grade) and November 12 (20 percent of grade)

3) In-Class Midterm Examination: Thursday October 17 (20 percent of grade)

4) Final exam (35 percent of grade)  

Late Policy: All late papers will be marked down a third of a grade (ex. A to A-) for each day following the due date. Teaching Fellows are not responsible for submission errors or corrupted/unreadable electronic files. Unreadable submissions may be marked late and dated to when a readable version is received.  
	
Collaboration in Written Work: Discussion and the exchange of ideas are essential to academic work. For assignments in this course, you are encouraged to consult with your classmates on the choice of paper topics and to share sources. You may find it useful to discuss your short paper topic with your peers, particularly if you are working on the same topic as a classmate. However, you should ensure that any written work you submit for evaluation is the result of your own work and reflects your own approach to the topic. You must also adhere to standard citation practices in this discipline and properly cite any books, articles, websites, lectures, etc. that have helped you with your work. If you receive significant help with your writing (e.g., feedback on drafts), you should also acknowledge this assistance.

Readings

All readings are available on the Canvas site. You will be assigned substantial parts of the following three books, which you may purchase online (we recommend this) or access via the Library Reserves tab on the Canvas site.

Alberto Alesina and Edward L. Glaeser, Fighting Poverty in the US and Europe: A World of Difference (Oxford University Press, 2004).

Sheila Fitzpatrick, The Russian Revolution (New York: Oxford University Press, 1982/2008).

Robert Putnam, Making Democracy Work (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993).

Max Weber, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (New York: Penguin, 2002)

 
Schedule and Assignments 

Week 1: Introduction and Approaches to Comparative Politics (September 3, 5)

September 3: Why You Should Care About Comparative Politics 

September 5: Approaches to Comparative Politics

Readings

David Samuels, Comparative Politics (Pearson, 2013), pp. 4-25.

Max Weber, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism
Part I: The Problem (all) (Penguin 2002 version: pp. 1-36)
Part II: The Idea of the Calling in Ascetic Protestantism
The Religious Foundations of Innerworldly Asceticism (read Calvinism but skip Pietism, Methodism, and Baptists) (Penguin version: pp. 67-87)
Asceticism and the Capitalist Spirit (all) (Penguin version: pp. 105-122)
Note: This is tough reading (it is a translation of early twentieth century German sociology). I include it because it is both a classic and an excellent example of a cultural approach to economic development, which we will discuss in Week 2.  The rest of the semester’s readings will be easier. Give this a try, and perhaps return to it after I discuss Weber in week 2 lecture.  Don’t get bogged down in details--focus on Weber’s main argument, which links early Protestant beliefs to the emergence of the kinds of economic practices we now associate with capitalism.
